<h1>Attendance Management using Face Recognition</h1>
<p>  <b>Attendance system using face
recognition is a procedure of recognizing students by using
face biostatistics based on the high definition of monitoring
and other computer technologies.</b> The development of this
the system is aimed to accomplish the digitization of the traditional
system of taking attendance by calling names and
maintaining pen-paper records. </p>
<p>Our approach is using the world’s simplest face recognition library built using dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. This face recognition model has high accuracy ensuring low false-positive detection, efficiency, and robust. After face recognition attendance reports will be generated and stored in Excel format. </p>
